# KyOS Installer Error Handling and User Experience Improvements

## Issue Addressed
During installation, users were seeing error messages like:
```
error: command failed to execute correctly
(13/15) Reloading system bus configuration...
Skipped: Running in chroot.
```

While these errors are normal and expected during installation, they were causing user concern.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Pacman Hooks**: During package installation, pacman hooks try to reload system services
2. **Chroot Environment**: These operations can't complete in chroot environment (normal behavior)
3. **Missing Context**: Users weren't informed that these warnings are expected
4. **Systemctl Commands**: Some systemctl operations weren't properly running in chroot context

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **User-Friendly Information Messages**

#### **Base System Installation**
Added informational messages to prepare users:
```bash
print_info "Installing the base system and bootloader."
echo "This may take several minutes depending on your internet connection."
echo "Note: Some warnings about system bus configuration or firmware are normal during installation."
```

#### **Desktop Installation**
```bash
print_info "Installing KyOS Qtile desktop packages."
echo "Installing desktop environment packages. This may show some warnings which are normal."
```

#### **Service Configuration**
```bash
echo "Enabling essential services."
echo "Note: Some service configuration warnings are normal during installation."
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging Integration**
Added logging to track installation progress:
```bash
log_message "INFO" "Starting base system installation with pacstrap"
# Installation command
log_message "SUCCESS" "Base system installation completed"
```

### 3. **Fixed Systemctl Context Issues**
**Problem**: Some systemctl commands were not running in chroot
**Solution**: Added proper `arch-chroot /mnt` prefix to all service commands

**Before:**
```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager 2>/dev/null
```

**After:**
```bash
arch-chroot /mnt systemctl enable NetworkManager 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. **Comprehensive Error Suppression**
Maintained existing error suppression (`2>/dev/null`) while adding context:
- Prevents unnecessary error spam
- Provides clear success/warning feedback
- Logs operations for troubleshooting

## Expected User Experience

### **Before Improvements:**
- Users saw unexplained error messages
- Uncertainty about whether installation was proceeding correctly
- Potential concern about system reliability

### **After Improvements:**
- Clear explanations that warnings are normal
- Progress feedback with logging integration
- Professional, reassuring installation experience
- Proper service configuration in chroot environment

## Error Types Now Handled

### **Normal/Expected Errors:**
1. **System bus reloading** - Cannot reload in chroot (expected)
2. **Firmware warnings** - Missing firmware for unused hardware (normal)
3. **Service configuration** - Some services can't start in chroot (expected)
4. **Hook execution** - Package hooks with chroot limitations (normal)

### **User Communication:**
- Proactive explanation that warnings are normal
- Clear progress indicators
- Success confirmations for completed operations
- Logging for post-installation review
