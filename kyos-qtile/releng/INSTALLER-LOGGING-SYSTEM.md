# KyOS Installer Logging System Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive logging functionality to all KyOS installer scripts to capture installation progress, errors, and create detailed reports for troubleshooting and verification.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Log File Creation**
- **Location**: `/var/log/kyos-install/` (falls back to `/tmp/kyos-install/` if not writable)
- **Naming**: Timestamped files (e.g., `kyos-install-20250704-142300.log`)
- **Types**: 
  - Main log file (all activities)
  - Error log file (errors only)
  - Installation report (final summary)

### 2. **Logging Functions**

#### `log_message(level, message)`
- Logs with timestamp and severity level
- Levels: INFO, CONFIG, SUCCESS, COMMAND
- Output to both console and log file

#### `log_error(message)`
- Logs errors to both main log and separate error log
- Critical for troubleshooting failed installations

#### `log_command(command)`
- Executes commands with full logging
- Captures exit codes and success/failure status
- Records both stdout and stderr

#### `create_install_report()`
- Generates comprehensive final report
- Includes system configuration, installation options, and status
- Lists all log file locations

### 3. **Enhanced Exit Handling**
- Automatic report generation on completion
- Displays log file locations to users
- Shows success/error status with file references
- Copies logs to installed system (`/mnt/var/log/kyos-install/`)

### 4. **Error Trapping**
- Set up `trap` to catch script failures
- Logs exact line and command that caused failure
- Ensures logs are preserved even on unexpected exits

## Files Modified

### **kyosinstall** (Interactive TUI Installer)
- Added full logging infrastructure
- Logs all configuration choices (username, disk, encryption, etc.)
- Captures backend installer output
- Enhanced error handling with log references
- Final report generation with installation summary

### **kyosinstall-auto** (Automated Installer)
- Complete logging system for automated installations
- Tracks all automated configuration choices
- Error handling with detailed failure logging
- Installation verification logging
- Final report with default settings summary

### **installer** (Launcher Script)
- Basic launcher activity logging
- Records when installation process is initiated

## Log File Structure

### **Main Log Format**
```
[2025-07-04 14:23:00] [INFO] KyOS Installation System v2.0.0 starting
[2025-07-04 14:23:05] [CONFIG] Username set to: kyos
[2025-07-04 14:23:10] [CONFIG] Target disk: /dev/sda
[2025-07-04 14:23:15] [COMMAND] Executing: pacstrap /mnt base
[2025-07-04 14:24:30] [SUCCESS] Command completed successfully: pacstrap /mnt base
[2025-07-04 14:25:00] [SUCCESS] KyOS installation completed successfully!
```

### **Error Log Format**
```
[2025-07-04 14:23:45] [ERROR] Command failed with exit code 1: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
[2025-07-04 14:23:46] [ERROR] Disk formatting failed - partition may be in use
```

### **Installation Report**
- Complete system configuration summary
- All selected options and settings
- Log file locations
- Final installation status
- Error summary if applicable

## Benefits

### **For Users**
- Clear feedback on installation progress
- Detailed troubleshooting information if installation fails
- Complete record of what was installed and configured
- Easy access to logs for support requests

### **For Developers**
- Comprehensive debugging information
- Installation success/failure tracking
- Performance monitoring (command execution times)
- User behavior insights (which options are selected)

### **For Support**
- Standardized log format for troubleshooting
- Complete installation timeline
- Error context and exact failure points
- System configuration verification

## Log Retention
- Logs remain on live system in `/tmp/kyos-install/` or `/var/log/kyos-install/`
- Automatically copied to installed system at `/var/log/kyos-install/`
- Users can access logs post-installation for reference
- Timestamped files prevent conflicts between multiple installation attempts

## Error Recovery
- Installation failures are logged with context
- Users get clear error messages with log file references
- Retry functionality preserves previous attempt logs
- Support can analyze failed installations from preserved logs

This logging system transforms the KyOS installer from a basic installation tool into a professional, enterprise-grade deployment system with full audit trails and troubleshooting capabilities.
