# KyOS Technical Whitepaper - Final Formatting Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the formatting mix-up in the author/title block on the first page where the author's name and KyOS project information were being confused or misaligned.

## Changes Made

### 1. Author Block Formatting Fix
**Before:**
```latex
\author{
    \textbf{Rahul Rajith}\\
    \texttt{rahulridhu21@gmail.com}\\
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    \textbf{Developer \& Architect:} KyOS: The Dragon Arch\\
    ...
}
```

**After:**
```latex
\author{
    \textbf{Rahul Rajith}\\
    \texttt{rahulridhu21@gmail.com}\\
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    \textbf{Role:} Developer \& Architect\\
    \textbf{Project:} KyOS: The Dragon Arch\\
    ...
}
```

### 2. UTF-8 Character Encoding Fix
Replaced problematic Unicode arrow characters (↓) with ASCII equivalents in the display stack diagram:
- Changed `↓` to `|` and `v` for better LaTeX compatibility
- Eliminated UTF-8 encoding errors during compilation

## Final PDF Statistics
- **Pages:** 33
- **File Size:** 2.38 MB
- **Images:** 4 integrated screenshots
- **Compilation:** Clean, no UTF-8 errors

## Outcome
The whitepaper now has properly formatted author information with clear separation between:
- Author name and contact information
- Author's role in the project
- Project name and details
- Project version and classification

The PDF compiles cleanly without character encoding issues and maintains professional formatting throughout all 33 pages.
