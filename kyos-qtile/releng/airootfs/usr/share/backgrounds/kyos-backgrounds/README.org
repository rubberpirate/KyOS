* About This Repo
The wallpapers found in /usr/share/backgrounds.kyos-backgrounds are part of a much bigger wallpaper collection that can be found [[https://github.com/rubberpirate/kyos-wallpapers][here]].

* Where Did I Get These Wallpapers?
I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [[https://imgur.com][Imgur]] and [[https://4chan.org/wg][/wg/]].  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

* Ownership
Because I downloaded most of these from sites like [[https://imgur.com][Imgur]] and [[https://4chan.org/wg][/wg/]], I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images.  If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
